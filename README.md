# corona-ampel
code for the CSH Corona Ampel (corona traffic-light), Austria &amp; World

- you need to supply a mapbox token in the index.html
- index.html accesses the minfied version of the page (code contained in minified.js) - for hosting online.
- index_notmini.html accesses the individual .js files within the /js folder - for testing/developing.
- you can switch between the Austria and World versions by setting the WORLD (=true) variable in data.js accordingly.


the following needs to be considered if you host this code online:
- clearly distinguish your version from this one (e.g., do not use our logo, the CSH name, and colors)
- refer to the original corona traffic light in the disclaimer: https://vis.csh.ac.at/corona-ampel/
- share the URL on which you host the page with us
